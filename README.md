Here's an easy way to get around it:

1. Install the [User Agent Overrider](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-overrider/) extension. This will allow you to "disguise" your browser.

2. Open the Preferences option for the extension and copy paste this User Agent in:
>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/40.0.2214.94 Safari/537.36

3. Open Whatsapp Web from your mobile device's settings in Whatsapp. 

4. Scan the QR code with your phone and you will be logged in on your computer.
